# Purpose
At the moment, Entomophagous is a loose collection of scripts and tools which
implement ideas from [Why Programs Fail](http://www.whyprogramsfail.com/) by
Andreas Zeller, about automated debugging techniques.

The magic 8-ball says: Ideally I implement all the techniques and deliver them
in an easy-, pleasant- and efficient-to-use form, perhaps combined with ideas
from elsewhere (including my ideas).

In the realistic short term: I implement something ;-)
